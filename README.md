Tumblr 'Object of the day'
=================

A simple Javascript proof of concept to demonstrate how a image-led Tumblr blog could be used in the VAM museum website. Tumblr is interesting as it reaches a new audience, but one that appreciates the striking, beautiful and interesting visuals, leading them to access the online catalogue for their further enjoyment.

A Tumblr showing an 'object of the day' seems like the best, simplest place to start. ( thevamuseum.tumblr.com )

This demo (using the great blo.cks.org service) simply takes the most recent post from this Tumblr via their API and displays it in the VAM front page template.
